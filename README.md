Hi, I'm Michael Noguera, currently a CS student at UW-Madison.

For more about me see my website at https://noguera.dev, where I post [projects](https://www.noguera.dev/#projects), a [longer bio](https://www.noguera.dev/about/), and infrequently upload some [blog articles](https://www.noguera.dev/#recent).
